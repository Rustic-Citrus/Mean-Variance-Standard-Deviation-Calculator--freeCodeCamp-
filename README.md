# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

Author: Harry Stuart Curtis

## Introduction

In this project, I created a script that takes a list of nine integers or floating-point numbers, converts them into a 3x3 matrix, then returns a dictionary of aggregate statistics for the rows, columns and the flattened matrix.

This project was taken from the Data Analysis with Python course at freeCodeCamp.org.
